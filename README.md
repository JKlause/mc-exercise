##Joe's thoughts on git hub branching

Pull before you push.

No work in master until the code is ready and done.

Pull before you branch.

The push doesn't matter, the merge is the thing that matters.

Don't:
Don't work or pull into master during development.
Communicating with PRing
Don't merge without communicating. DAVE IS MERGE MASTER.
