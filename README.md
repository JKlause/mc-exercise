## Dave's learnings from the pab exercise

- pull before you push
- never work directly in the master branch
- make sure your workspace is up to date before you branch
- git fetch is a useful command to see what
- communicate to the team when you make a PR
- merges can be handled by a merge-master. I have been unanimously nominated and I accept.
