Never work on master.

Push before you branch.

Team approval for merges.

As Sensei Dave always says, "Pull Before You Push."

Working and pulling into Master during development caused lots of problems.

Lack of communication and the chaotic environment made conflicts appear.

## Dave's learnings from the lab exercise

- pull before you push
- never work directly in the master branch
- make sure your workspace is up to date before you branch
- git fetch is a useful command to see what
- communicate to the team when you make a PR
- merges can be handled by a merge-master. I have been unanimously nominated and I accept.

## Joe's thoughts on git hub branching

Pull before you push.

No work in master until the code is ready and done.

Pull before you branch.

The push doesn't matter, the merge is the thing that matters.

Don't:
Don't work or pull into master during development.
Communicating with PRing
Don't merge without communicating. DAVE IS MERGE MASTER.
